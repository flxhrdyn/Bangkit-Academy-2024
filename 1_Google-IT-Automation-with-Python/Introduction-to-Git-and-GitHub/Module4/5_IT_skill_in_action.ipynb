    "Well done! You've gained a strong foundation in various crucial aspects of IT, from version control to project management. You’ve also practiced how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement version control using git and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "- Branch and merge your work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secure and restore repositories \n",
    "\n",
    "- Resolve code conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run code reviews and manage pull requests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use versioning to track and manage projects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, let's put your skills into action with a real-world scenario that encompasses the lessons you've learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The project\n",
    "Imagine you're part of an IT team responsible for developing and managing a software project. Your team is using Git for version control, collaborating on coding tasks, and ensuring project success. Let's walk through the process step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Before Version Control:__ Before diving into code, ensure your team is aligned on the project's scope, goals, and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Version control systems:__ Choose Github as your version control system to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a history of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Using git:__ Start by initializing a Github repository, committing your initial code, and using git status and git log to manage and track changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Advanced git interaction:__ Use advanced commands like git diff to visualize changes, git stash to temporarily hide changes, and git tag to mark significant milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Undoing things:__ Use git reset and git revert to undo changes and address errors in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Branching and merging:__ Create branches for feature development using git branch, switch between branches with git checkout, and merge changes using git merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Secure shells & API keys:__ Ensure security by using SSH keys and managing sensitive data like API keys properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solving conflicts:__ Resolve conflicts that arise from merging branches using git merge or pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pull requests:__ Open pull requests to propose changes, review code, and discuss modifications with your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code reviews:__ Participate in code reviews to maintain code quality, identify improvements, and ensure best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Managing projects:__ Organize your project using project boards, milestones, and issues to track progress and prioritize tasks.\n",

    "__Version control systems:__ You create a feature branch for the authentication system on the app's existing repository that is already located on github. Your team uses this new branch to begin to work on the tasks associated with the feature request.All progress is tracked in real time and documented with comments in Github."
