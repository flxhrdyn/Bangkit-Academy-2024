    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."

    "## 1. Class Methods\n",
    "In Python, methods are behaviors associated with object parameters that modify the state of that object. They are essentially functions that belong to a specific instance of a class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of the list, and not all lists globally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you create an instance of a class, Python calls a special class method the constructor. The constructor’s job is to set up the object, meaning that instance of the class, so it’s ready to be used. Usually this means initializing some variables and doing other simple housekeeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a Python class, you define a method called __init__ to be your constructor. The special name tells Python to use that method as the constructor. Just like any other method, the constructor can take arguments. When making an argument to the class, the first constructor must always be self."

    "## 2. Defining a class method\n",
    "Classes define the behavior of all instances of a specific class. In Python, the code defining a class is, itself, an object; classes can be used without instantiating a single object, such as when using static methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, each variable of a specific class is an instance or object."
