It can be used to write a variety of tests including: integration, end-to-end, and functional tests. It supports automatic test discovery and generates informative test reports. \n",

    "## 1. How to write tests\n",
    "Pytests are written with functions that use the operation, assert(). An assert is a commonly used debugging tool in Python that allows programmers to include sanity checks in their code. They ensure certain conditions or assumptions hold true during runtime. If the condition provided to assert() turns out to be false, it indicates a bug in the code, an exception is raised, and halts the program’s execution. Typically, code provides an assert condition followed by an optional message. \n",

    "## 3. Comparing unittest and pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "Both unittest and pytest provide developers with tools to create robust and reliable code through different forms of tests. Both can be used while creating programs within Python, and it is the developer’s preference on which type they want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn about the differences between unittest and pytest, and when to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key differences\n",
    "Unittest is a tool that is built directly into Python, while pytest must be imported from outside your script. Test discovery acts differently for each test type. Unittest has the functionality to automatically detect test cases within an application, but it must be called from the command line. Pytests are performed automatically using the prefix test_. Unittests use an object-oriented approach to write tests, while pytests use a functional approach. Pytests use built-in assert statements, making tests easier to read and write. On the other hand, unittests provide special assert methods like assertEqual() or assertTrue().\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward compatibility exists between unittest and pytest. Because unittest is built directly into Python, these test suites are more easily executed. But that doesn’t mean that pytest cannot be executed. Because of backward compatibility, the unittest framework can be seamlessly executed using the pytest framework without major modifications. This allows developers to adopt pytest gradually and integrate them into their code."
